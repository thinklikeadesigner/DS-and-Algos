# DS-and-Algos

Hello, this is my personal repo where I'm posting translations of data structures and algorithms into javascript. 

Feel free to make an issue if you find a mistake, because I am translating these by hand and I'm not an expert. 


## repo structure

The repo is organized by data structures, with an implementation in javascript and the original implementation in java.

I put the java one in there so you could see the original code that I am changing into javascript.

## more resources
I will also post a link to the post i used to help convert the java implementation to the javascript implementation at the top of each file, as well as other articles I find useful

## one more thing, i'm lazy so i don't like using console.log
at the top of each javascript file, i have a custom function that allows me to use print instead of console.log
feel free to use it, or just use console.log

``` javascript
function print(x) {
    console.log(x);
}

```
