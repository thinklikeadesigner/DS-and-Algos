# DS-and-Algos

Hello, this is my personal repo where I'm posting data structures, algorithms, and notes related to data structures or algorithms. I also have practice problems from various coding sites on here, as well as some various implementations that I've come up on across the world wide web. Feel free to explorer and mark issues where you see them.


## repo structure

I really don't have a way to organize content yet, since this is a personal wiki. Though, I'm trying to link relevant sections to eachother. There are leetcode/hackerrank solutions on here but I don't have the problem statements. Although, I plan on adding those later so you can do the problems yourselves.

## more resources
I will also post a link to the post i used to help convert the java implementation to the javascript implementation at the top of each file, as well as other articles I find useful

## one more thing, i'm lazy so i don't like using console.log
at the top of each javascript file, i have a custom function that allows me to use print instead of console.log
feel free to use it, or just use console.log

``` javascript
function print(x) {
    console.log(x);
}

```
