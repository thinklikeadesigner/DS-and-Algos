# Queues

## singly linked lists versus doubly linked lists pros and cons

Terminology
adding elements to back of queue can be called enqueueing, adding, or offering
removing elements from front of queueu can be called dequeueing, removing, or polling

## Implementations
- linked lists (single and double)
    - single
        - push tail forward for enqueu
        - push head forward for dequeu

- array

## USES

waiting in line at movies or restaurant etc
keep track of x most recent elements
server management, server processes initial requests and puts rest in a queueu until done
Bread first search (BFS) graph traversal


## Stack complexity analysis


- enqueue  <strong>O(1)<strong>

- dequeue  <strong>O(1)<strong>

- peeking (last element)  <strong>O(1)<strong>

- contains (not first or last element) <strong>O(n)<strong>

- removal (not first or last element) <strong>O(n)<strong>

- is empty  <strong>O(1)<strong>
