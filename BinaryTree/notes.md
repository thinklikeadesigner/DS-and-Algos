# Binary tree

## definition
****
## Terminology
- a ***binary search tree*** is a binary tree that satisfies the binary search tree invariant: left subtree has smaller lements and right subtree has larger elements
- binary tree has at most 2 children
- **complete binary tree** every level, except the last, is completely filled and all the nodes are as far left as possible. level per level it fills left to right.

## tree definitions

- a tree is an undirected graph which is
  - connected graph with n nodes and n-1 edges
  - acyclic 
  - any 2 vertices are connected by exactly one path

- if we have a rooted tree, then we will want to have a reference to the root node of our tree. it does not always matter which node you select because any node can root the tree
- a child node goes downwards and a parents are upward
- what is the parent of the root node? it has no parrent, all though it may be useful to assign the parent of the root node as itself
- a leaf node is a node that has no children
- a subtree is a tree entirely contained within another. *subtrees may consist of a single node*
